<h1> Tic Tac Ai ! </h1>
<h3>A completely normal TicTacToe AI game</h3>

<br>

<h3> This is just a messy coded little project I had/have, to refresh my Java knowledge!</h3><br>
<h3><u>How does it work:</u><br><br>
Just look at the code, I'm too dumb to explain.<br>
Main AI method is executeAi() by the way.</h3>

<br>

<h3> Settings - There are some Settings you can find in the Main.java file<br></h3>
<h3>- IsIntelliJ (boolean):
<br>The IntelliJ IDEA does not use the generic console so
it cannot clear it. If enabled will NOT display a strange character
at the beginning of new output.</h3>
